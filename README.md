# Piju piju

Piju piju is a simple game made in **Unity**.
You play as a small starship, destroying the asteroids that come in your path.
I managed to draw everything, record background music, do the audio effects and create everything myself.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/jokilic/piju_piju/releases/download/1.0/piju_piju.apk).

## Two modes of play

### White mode

If you find yourself wanting to destroy some asteroids in the middle of a sunny day, the white mode is for you.

### Black mode

If you see yourself in your bed, not able to sleep, playing black mode is something you'll love.

## Highscores

I have implemented online highscores for both modes.
Check if you have what it takes to be at the number one.
