# Piju piju

Piju piju is a simple game made in **Unity**.
You play as a small starship, destroying the asteroids that come in your path.
I managed to draw everything, record background music, do the audio effects and create everything myself.
Online highscores are available so you can compete with your friends and see who is the master of Piju piju.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.josip.pijupiju).

## Two modes of play

### White mode

If you find yourself wanting to destroy some asteroids in the middle of a sunny day, the white mode is for you.

### Black mode

If you see yourself in your bed, not able to sleep, playing black mode is something you'll love.

## Highscores

I have implemented online highscores for both modes.
Check if you have what it takes to be at the number one.
